Cybonix-Solutions-Trainer---CYSTR

CYSTR is going to be an Android application for the Cybonix Solutions Facebook page, that will feature do-it-yourself (DIY) computer troubleshooting videos.

The goal is to make an application that is simple to use, with good quality videos, that are quickly pause-able to show step-by-step instructions.
